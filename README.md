# Penguini

Our submission for [LeafyJam](https://itch.io/jam/leafyjam)  -- our first game jam ever. 

Made in Unity, an engine we'd never used.

## Gameplay

Walk around, collect pumpkins, apples, carrots and fish!

Get yelled at by the shadow man trying to steal your crops!

See how many items you're willing to collect!
